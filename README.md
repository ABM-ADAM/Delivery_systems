## 🚀 Overview

This repository implements **NP-JEPA**, a hybrid AI framework for intelligent, robust, and policy-compliant routing in multi-modal logistics systems. The system supports real-time delivery decisions across **aerial**, **road**, and **rail** networks while accounting for environmental uncertainties, regulatory norms, and payload limits.

> 🧪 This work is in preparation for submission to a top-tier journal in intelligent transportation systems.
